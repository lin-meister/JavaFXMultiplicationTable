# JavaFXMultiplicationTable

This is a simple application created using Java that creates a 10x10 multiplication table displayed in a JavaFX Window. 
The user can type an integer between 0 and 100 which will represent the product, and the multiplication table cells that yields a 
product of that integer will have its CSS styling changed to reflect its match.
